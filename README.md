# Object-Oriented Programming

> ### Paradigm  
> A style to program in.  
> A paradigm helps to reduce complexity of a program.  
> A way of doing thing.

## What ?
Based on a concept of "Objects"
It's a Paradigm.


Model real world thing. (Dog, Car) with  
Objects = State, Behavior

### Why?
Code Structure  
Modularity  
Directly associate real-world problems.  

### How?  
Objects, Classes, Inheritance, Interfaces, Packages  
or  
Class, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

## String

### What?
Object  
java.lang.String  
char[]  
Immutable - non-changeable  

se.lexicon.object_basics.Car

### Why?
Convenient  
Frequently used for storing a lot of characters.  

### How?
Syntax: ""  

String name = "";  
String name = new string();  

---

## Class Inheritance

### What?  
Core feature of OOP  
Structure to handle complexity in your program.  
hierarchy  

animal -> mammal -> Dog  
animal -> mammal -> Cat  
animal -> Bird -> Eagle


### Why?  
Clear intentions - Readability  
Reusable code


### How?  
Syntax/Keyword: extends  

ex.

```Java
class A{}

class B extends A {}
```
